After an argument, the unidentified \u201csubject\u201d (believed to be Hill) slapped one of the employees on his neck with an open hand while he was being removed from the argument and ran toward the victim, but several people restrained him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The subject then fled the area, according to the report.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dolphins issued a statement regarding the situation, and it pretty much was what one should expect in circumstances like these.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are aware of the situation and have been in contact with Tyreek, his representatives and the NFL,&#8221; the statement read. &#8220;We will reserve further comment at this time.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-happens-next\">WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Dolphins done with the offseason program and the start of training camp more than a month away, this is the time of year when no news is good news when it comes to players.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dolphins no doubt will continue to monitor the situation, as will the NFL and the league&#8217;s Code of Conduct could come into play depending on how things play out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hill is heading into his second season with Miami after a first one that met \u2014 if not exceeded \u2014 all expectations the team could have had when it sent five draft picks to the Kansas City Chiefs to consummate the trade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only did Hill earn team MVP and All-Pro honors, he was a tone-setter with his practice habits and confident approach from the start of the offseason program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>He&#8217;s looking for bigger and better things in 2023, saying after the final practice of minicamp his goal was to reach 2,000 receiving yards.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The weekend incident, though, brought back earlier off-the-field incidents that threatened to derail his career \u2014 he was dismissed from Oklahoma State after being charged with domestic abuse (he later pleaded guilty) and was investigated in 2019 for alleged battery, though the case was dropped after medical reports indicated his 3-year-old son&#8217;s arm was broken bracing for a fall. The NFL investigated Hill but ultimately did not suspend him after concluding he had not violated the league&#8217;s code of conduct policy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the trade with the Chiefs, Dolphins GM Chris Grier was asked about the kind of background work that was done regarding Hill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGoing forward, we feel good about it,&#8221; Grier said. &#8220;We talked to a number of people that have been around Tyreek, especially in Kansas City the last few years. For us, we\u2019re comfortable moving forward and the expectation, like him, will be for every player on the roster \u2014 it\u2019s to be a good teammate and a good citizen in South Florida.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hill has been doing football camps on a regular basis this offseason, including one in Boca Raton late this week.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It has been almost a week now since the incident involving Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill at a North Miami Beach marina, and there remains a lot that is unknown.
